# Shippo PHP Client
This package aims to provide a more usable way of interacting with the Shippo API than https://github.com/goshippo/shippo-php-client. The official php client is a bit of a pain to use since it's not really construcuted in a modern fashion, e.g. the namespaceing is poor, properties are accessed via magic methods, etc.

This is very much a work in progress and PRs are welcome.
